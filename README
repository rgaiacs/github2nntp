GitHub2NNTP
===========

This is one-way gateway between GitHub and a local NNTP server like leafnode.

Why I write this?
-----------------

GitHub have a API for access logs of public information but it not provide a
RSS/Atom feed for this information (except if you have a account, watch some
repos and use the web interface).

I can't find a nice script to produce a RSS/Atom feed for issues and since I
like NNTP I write this.

Quick start
-----------

The basic configuration can placed in ``~/.github2nntp.conf`` where each line
must be of the form ::

    newsgroup.name	owner	repo

Note that the fields are separate by tab.

If you have a GitHub account you can use your token
(https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) to increase the number of
request per minute. For it, save the token in ``~/.github2nntp.token``.

To fetch the issues, running ::

    $ github2nntp

You might like add it into your cron job list.

Some information for the next running are need and it will be save at
``~/.github2nntp.status``. If having troubles you can try remove this file.

A log of the last running are keeped in ``~/.github2nntp.log``.
